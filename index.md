[Popper](http://falsifiable.us) is a convention and CLI tool for 
conducting experiments and writing academic articles following best 
[OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and 
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) practices. The 
open-source CLI tool helps researchers organize all the artifacts 
associated to a scientific exploration inside a code repository such 
as Git. These “popperized” repositories are self-contained and can be 
easily shared (cloned via Git) so that others can replicate the 
original results (see examples [here](https://github.com/popperized)).

This lesson describes the experimentation protocol and the Popper CLI 
tool; it gives examples from multiple domains showing how to follow 
the protocol; and also shows how to use a CI system to continuously 
validate Popperized experiments.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> In this lesson we use the [Unix Shell](). Some previous experience 
> with using the shell to list directories, create, copy, remove and 
> list files and directories, and run simple scripts is necessary. 
> Some familiarity with [Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice) 
> makes it easier to follow the episodes but is not required.
